A simple Expat C++ Wrapper inspired by the simplicity of ExpatMM and the design of PocoXML.

AeonXML attempts to be as standalone as possible, if you want to use it, you basically just need
to add the source and include files to your project since it ships with expat 2.0.1.

Makefiles are missing at the moment.

See example.cpp for example usage, you can use test.xml with the example program to play around 
with the parser.
